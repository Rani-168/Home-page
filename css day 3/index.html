<!-- CSS Box Model -->
<!-- The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. It describes how the
elements on a web page are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. The box model consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin. -->
<!-- 1. Content: This is the innermost part of the box where the actual content (text, images, etc.) is displayed. The width and height of the content area can be set using CSS properties like width and height. -->
<!-- 2. Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the border. It creates
    space inside the element. You can set padding using the padding property in CSS. -->
<!-- 3. Border: The border is a line that surrounds the padding (if any) and content. You can customize the border's width, style, and color using CSS properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color. -->
<!-- 4. Margin: Margin is the outermost layer of the box model. It creates space outside the element, separating it from other elements on the page. You can set margins using the margin property in CSS. -->
<!-- Understanding the box model is crucial for designing and laying out web pages effectively. It helps you control the spacing and alignment of elements, ensuring that your designs look as intended across different devices and screen sizes. -->
